          Egg coffee is a unique beverage from Hanoi, created by combining
          coffee, fresh egg yolks, condensed milk, and sugar. The egg yolk is

          which is then layered on top of strong black coffee, creating an
          incredibly enticing drink. This coffee has a rich, creamy, and subtly
          sweet taste, offering a perfect blend of coffee and egg flavors that
